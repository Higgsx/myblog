Blog on my red teaming journey. My Main objective is learning complex topics through teaching others, that forces me to dig deep and don't just execute "hackish" commands without understanding deeper meaning. Second objective is teaching others, because sharing knowledge strenghtens community and helps beginner folks to build up their cyber security career.
